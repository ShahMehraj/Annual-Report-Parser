# Annual Report Parser

## Overview

**Annual Report Parser** is a Streamlit-based application designed to extract financial data from PDF annual reports. This tool leverages the power of OpenAI APIs and LangChain for embedding, vector storage, and question-answering, making it easy to analyze financial documents and retrieve key insights in a structured format.

## Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Parses multiple PDF files and extracts text content efficiently.
- **Text Chunking**: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks for better processing.
- **Vector Store Creation**: Utilizes FAISS for creating and storing vectorized representations of document chunks.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Employs OpenAI models for embeddings and natural language processing.
- **Financial Data Extraction**: Extracts specific financial details like company name, business segments, currency, and revenue.
- **Excel Export**: Generates structured financial data in an Excel file for easy reporting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShahMehraj/Annual-Report-Parser.git
   cd Annual-Report-Parser
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
